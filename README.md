# InfectiousDiseaseRates

This project demonstrates basic Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered disease models. 

The SI model shows us the rate of susceptible vs infected people over time.

The SIR model illustrates the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered people over time along with how many cases of the disease are occuring over time.
I have also included a SIR diagram, which shows how many susceptible people become infected and how many infected people recover.


Why are these models important?

Epidemiology is the study and analysis of the distribution, patterns and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations. 
It is a cornerstone of public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and 
targets for preventive healthcare. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to understand how and why diseases spread so we can protect out health
and live longer. My models only scratch the surface on this topic but I thought it is a great ice breaker into epidemiology!
