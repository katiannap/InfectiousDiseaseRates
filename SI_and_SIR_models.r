# Running a Basic Susceptible-Infected (SI) disease model in which there is random mixing within the population
#`contactâ€™ has been defined several ways in the modeling literature, we use the word act to represent the action, 
# such as face-to-face discussion or sexual intercourse, by which disease may be transmitted

# To simulate a deterministic model in EpiModel, use the dcm function
# Prior to running the model, it is necessary to parameterize it. 

# param.dcm, the epidemic model parameters are entered
# inf.prob argument sets the transmission probability per act
# act.rate sets the acts (aka contact) per person per unit time
# init.dcm function collects the initial conditions for the model
# control.dcm finally collects other structural model controls like the model type and number of time steps for the simulation
# nsteps is the amount of time
# type is the type of model, in this case Susceptible-Infected (SI) disease model

param <- param.dcm(inf.prob = 0.5, act.rate = 0.25)
init <- init.dcm(s.num = 500, i.num = 1)
control <- control.dcm(type = "SI", nsteps = 100)

# model parameters, initial conditions, and controls are then entered as inputs into the dcm function to run the model 
# and save the output in our object mod
mod <- dcm(param, init, control)

# Plotting

# popfrac=FALSE argument plots the compartment size (rather than prevalence) 
# alpha increases the transparency of the lines for better visualization
# By default, the plot function will plot the prevalences for all compartments in the model, 
# but in the right plot we override that using the
# si.flow - y argument to specify that disease incidence 

# legend options are set using the legend
# specify a single line color, a vector of colors, or a color palette using the col

# Summaries
# Previously, the time-specific model values were calculated with the summary function. To visualize that information, use the comp_plot function. 
# This plot provides astate-flow diagram that is often presented in the epidemiological literature.
